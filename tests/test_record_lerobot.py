"""The parts of recording that only a real LeRobotDataset can answer.

Everything in test_record.py runs against a fake sink, which is what makes the
loop testable at all. These tests are the other half: they write real datasets
to a temp dir and read them back, because the questions here are about what
LeRobot actually does, not about what this package asks it to do -- and the
answers have changed between LeRobot versions.

Skipped when ``lerobot`` is not importable, which is the normal state on a robot
box (the extra needs Python 3.12+ and pulls torch).
