// Heartbeat-based watchdog for the unified move-to-ready and emergency-recovery state machines.
// Each move-to-ready (startup, command-driven, or emergency) is allowed to take as long as it
// needs (a slow ready move on a heavy arm can run for tens of seconds), but every successful
// ``step()`` iteration must refresh ``last_step_heartbeat_``. If no heartbeat arrives for this
// many milliseconds, ``check_emergency_timeout_locked`` flips the state to TIMED_OUT and the
// device is force-parked. This catches the case where the control loop has actually hung
// (deadlock or blocked device I/O) without punishing a legitimately slow recovery.
// Configurable via --emergency_shutdown_timeout_ms.
